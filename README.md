# Automated Transphobic Complaint Filing Tool
This code automates the process of filing a fake complaint against a Republican senator in Missouri, accusing them of being transgender and seeking transgender surgery. The complaint is filed using the Missouri Attorney General’s “Transgender Center Concerns” form, and the code generates a fake citizen and address to fill out the form.
